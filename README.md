## Automated Mailserver

A little bash script, which does the most work
to install a mail server. It's based on the
tutorial from <https://www.thomas-leister.de>

You can find the complete tutorial here <https://thomas-leister.de/internet/mailserver-ubuntu-server-dovecot-postfix-mysql/>

At the moment it isn't complete and it needs a bit more testing.
